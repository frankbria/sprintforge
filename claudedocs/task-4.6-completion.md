- **Test Suites**: 4 passed (100%)
- **Test Cases**: 54 passed (100%)

### Test Files Created
1. `ProjectList.test.tsx` - 14 test cases
2. `StatisticsCards.test.tsx` - 11 test cases
3. `ActivityFeed.test.tsx` - 15 test cases
4. `QuickActions.test.tsx` - 14 test cases

### Test Coverage Breakdown
```
File                    | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines
------------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------
ActivityFeed.tsx        |   94.87 |    90.00 |  100.00 |   94.28
ProjectList.tsx         |   90.90 |    86.66 |   81.25 |   90.90
QuickActions.tsx        |   91.30 |    83.33 |  100.00 |   91.30
StatisticsCards.tsx     |  100.00 |    83.33 |  100.00 |  100.00
```

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/v1/projects` - List projects with search/sort/pagination
- `DELETE /api/v1/projects/:id` - Delete project
- `POST /api/v1/projects/:id/generate` - Generate Excel file

### Data Flow
1. Dashboard fetches projects with TanStack Query
2. Statistics calculated from project data client-side
3. Activity feed generated from project lifecycle events
4. Mutations invalidate queries for automatic UI updates

## User Experience

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts adapt to screen sizes (1/2/4 columns)
- Touch-friendly action menus
- Optimized for tablets and desktop

### Performance
- Skeleton loading states prevent layout shifts
- Query caching reduces API calls
- Debounced search for reduced network traffic
- Optimistic UI updates for mutations

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML throughout
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for modals/menus
