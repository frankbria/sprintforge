**Issue Prefix**: `sf-`
**Current Sprint**: Sprint 4 (83% complete - 5/6 tasks done)

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the SprintForge implementation plan using the beads issue tracking system. The beads are structured to enable dependency-aware task management for AI developers working on the project.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# View all open issues
bd list --status open

# View ready work (no blockers)

## Priority Levels

- **P0 (Critical)**: Current sprint work, blocks major features
- **P1 (High)**: Next sprint planning, important features
- **P2 (Medium)**: Future sprints, nice-to-have features
- **P3 (Low)**: Long-term roadmap items
- **P4 (Minimal)**: Backlog items for future consideration

## For AI Developers

### Getting Started
1. Run `bd ready` to see available work
2. Check `bd show <issue-id>` for task details
3. Update status with `bd update <issue-id> --status in_progress`
4. Close completed tasks with `bd close <issue-id> --reason "Description"`

### Creating New Issues
```bash
# Create a bug fix
bd create "Fix Excel formula calculation" -p 0 -t bug -d "Description" --deps "blocks:sf-9"

# Create a feature
bd create "Add CSV export" -p 2 -t feature -d "Export projects to CSV format"

# Create a subtask
bd create "Unit tests for dashboard" -p 1 -t task --deps "parent-child:sf-9"
```

### Workflow Best Practices
1. Always check dependencies before starting work
2. Update issue status as work progresses
3. Document completion reasons when closing issues
4. Create new issues when discovering related work
5. Use appropriate dependency types:
   - `blocks`: Must complete before target
   - `parent-child`: Epic/subtask relationship
   - `related`: Soft connection, doesn't block
   - `discovered-from`: Found during other work

### Current Priorities
1. **Immediate**: Complete Task 4.6 (Project Dashboard) - sf-9
2. **Next**: Begin Sprint 5 tasks once sf-9 is complete
3. **Future**: Plan Sprint 6 collaboration features

## Database Integration

The beads database (`.beads/sf.db`) is designed for extension. Applications can:
- Add custom tables for project-specific data
- Join with the issues table for powerful queries
- Track execution history and metrics
- Store AI agent context and decisions

## Git Integration

Beads automatically syncs with Git:
- Exports to JSONL after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer than DB
- Works seamlessly across team members
- No manual export/import needed

## Notes

- All Sprint 4 tasks except Dashboard (sf-9) are complete
- Sprint 5 tasks are blocked until sf-9 completes
- Sprint 6 tasks are independent and can start anytime
- Version 2.0+ features are long-term roadmap items
- Current focus should be on completing Sprint 4 to unblock Sprint 5
