# SprintForge Product Requirements Document
*Working Title - Final name pending domain availability*

## Executive Summary

SprintForge is an open-source, macro-free project management system that generates sophisticated Excel spreadsheets with Gantt chart capabilities and probabilistic timeline predictions. Unlike existing solutions, SprintForge prioritizes agile sprint planning, enterprise security requirements, and multi-user collaboration while maintaining Excel as the portable source of truth.

### Core Differentiators
1. **Macro-free architecture** - Enterprise deployable without security warnings
2. **Sprint-native planning** - First-class support for agile methodologies
3. **Probabilistic scheduling** - Monte Carlo simulations for confidence intervals
4. **Collaboration layer** - Multi-user updates with Excel as source of truth
5. **Truly open source** - MIT licensed core with transparent pricing
6. **AI-enhanced** - Optional AI assistance for planning and estimation

## Product Vision

### Mission Statement
Enable teams to create sophisticated project plans that are both powerful enough for complex enterprises and simple enough to share as Excel files, without compromising on security, collaboration, or analytical capabilities.

## Appendix

### Competitive Analysis Summary
- **GanttExcel**: Feature-rich but macro-dependent, single-user
- **MS Project**: Industry standard but expensive, complex
- **TeamGantt**: Good collaboration but not Excel-native
- **Monday.com**: Modern but proprietary, expensive
- **OpenProject**: Open source but not Excel-focused

### Technology Decisions
- Python over Node.js for backend: Better numerical libraries
- React over Vue: Larger ecosystem, enterprise acceptance
- PostgreSQL over MySQL: Better JSON support, extensions
- OpenPyXL over XlsxWriter: More features, active development

### Open Questions
1. Should we support .xlsb binary format for performance?
2. How deep should Jira integration go?
3. Should we build a VSCode extension?
4. Is there value in a desktop app (Electron)?
5. Should we pursue B Corp certification?
